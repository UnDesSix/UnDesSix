### Hi there 👋

Now a software and data engineer, I previously dedicated three years to real estate analysis and credit.

This ambition led me to pursue specialized training in 2020, enabling me to combine my financial skills with in-depth technical knowledge. My goal was clear: to be able to address specific business needs and create my own projects. Today, I focus on designing innovative data products tailored for decision-making, leveraging my experience at the intersection of analysis and technology.
